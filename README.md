### Outline

Hour 1: Opening web browsers (using python stdlib `webbrowser`)
* Introduction and installation of python
* Code Along Task: Take a command line argument like `CS 125` and open the web browser to the `courses.illinois` page because the website doesn't directly let you jump to courses
* Exercise: Take a chapter number for the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and open directly to that webpage
Hour 2: Selenium 
* Selenium `pip` install
  - (UIUC SAIL version) Code Along Task: Open up the CS Sail homepage, click the navbar `Staff` link, hover the mouse on the `overlay` and select all staff names because we want to make them a thank you card.
  - (CS 125 version)    Code Along Task: Open up the CS 125 homepage, click the sidebar, click the people page, select all staff names because we want to make them a thank you card.
